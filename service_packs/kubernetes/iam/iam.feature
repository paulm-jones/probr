Feature: Ensure stringent authentication and authorisation
  As a Security Auditor
  I want to ensure that stringent authentication and authorisation policies are applied to my organisation's Kubernetes clusters
  So that only approved actors have the ability to perform sensitive operations in order to prevent malicious attacks on my organization

  Background:
    Given a Kubernetes cluster is deployed
    And the cluster has managed identity components deployed

  Scenario Outline: Prevent cross namespace Azure Identities
    # TODO PJITREVIEW remove implementation detail from here
    And an AzureIdentityBinding called "probr-aib" exists in the namespace called "default"
    When I create a simple pod in "<NAMESPACE>" namespace assigned with the "probr-aib" AzureIdentityBinding
    Then the pod is deployed successfully
    But an attempt to obtain an access token from that pod should "<RESULT>"

    Examples:
      | NAMESPACE   | RESULT  |
      | the probr   | Fail    |
      | the default | Succeed |

  Scenario: Prevent cross namespace Azure Identity Bindings
    # TODO PJITREVIEW remove implementation detail from here
    # TODO PJITREVIEW add additional Given to satisfy the positive case
    # Use more general terms like "my namespace" "another namespace"
    And the namespace called "default" has an AzureIdentity called "probr-probe"
    When I create an AzureIdentityBinding called "probr-aib" in the Probr namespace bound to the "probr-probe" AzureIdentity
    And I deploy a pod assigned with the "probr-aib" AzureIdentityBinding into the Probr namespace
    Then the pod is deployed successfully
    But an attempt to obtain an access token from that pod should fail

  Scenario: Prevent access to AKS credentials via Azure Identity Components

  On the agent node VMs in the Kubernetes cluster, service principal credentials are stored in the file
  /etc/kubernetes/azure.json, which should therefore be protected.

  See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-service-principal

    When I execute the command "cat /etc/kubernetes/azure.json" against the MIC pod
    Then Kubernetes should prevent me from running the command

  Scenario Outline: Minimise wildcards in Roles and Cluster Roles

  Kubernetes roles provide access to resources. Using wildcards does not adhere to the security principle of least
  privilege. Other than known system-assigned and well understood role definitions (which are configurable in Probr),
  we should not expect to use wildcards.

    When I inspect the "<rolelevel>" that are configured
    Then I should only find wildcards in known and authorised configurations

    Examples:
      | rolelevel     |
      | Roles         |
      | Cluster Roles |
